Basic implementation of landmark morphing attacks (LMA).

Run generate_dataset.m to generate a dataset of face morphs

You will need to have [2] placed in the appropriate directory and may need to modify environment path variables.

To add \bin directory of [2] to windows PATH environment variable go to:
system properties -> advanced -> environment variables -> Path -> edit -> new

You will need to add [3] to the MATLAB path.
You can use MATLAB's add-on explorer to add [3] to the path.

Based on the combined morphing pipeline from [1].
Uses [2] for landmark location.
Uses [3] for image splicing.
